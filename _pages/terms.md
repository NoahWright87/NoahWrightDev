//TODO: Find a good privacy policy to copy/paste/modify.

The tldr is:
- I use Google Analytics to track visitors so I can see who is visiting and why - this helps me see which posts people are engaging with, I'm not using it for anything nefarious
- Google Ads uses its own stuff to decide what ads to show, hopefully so you see relevant stuff and not nonsense around my posts.  I don't decide what is in those ads, so take them with a grain of salt.  If you see anything outrageous, please contact me to let me know so I can complain to Google.
- If I link to a product in a post, chances are it's an affiliate link that will generate money for me if you buy things.  The goal of this site is not to make money, so I only link to products I actually recommend
- If I get your info through any means, I'm keeping it to myself.  I'm not selling anybody's info or trying to steal your identity, so don't worry about it.
