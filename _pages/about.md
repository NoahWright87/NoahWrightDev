**Hi, I'm Noah!**

![Noah Wright, site owner](/assets/images/noahwright-sm.jpg){: .align-right .img-thumbnail}

I'm a software engineer, Air Force veteran, and proud husband and father.  I got into programming due to a love for video games,
but realized early in my career that software has the capability of making people's lives better.  One of my first programming
jobs was at a small place where I could see the effect of every line of code I wrote.  Sometimes a bug would grind business to a
halt, but other days I could see my software taking the weight of some task off of one of the employees.  People ask what our
purpose is in this world, but I think it's really simple:

Leave the world better than you found it.

I know I can't change the world, but I can at least tidy things up as I go.  To me, that means writing the best code I can, trying
my best to deliver value to my customers, teaching my kids to avoid the mistakes I ran into, and treating the people around me with
respect.

If I sound like the kind of person you want to hear more from, check out [my blog posts](/posts/).  There you will find stories
of success and failure, life advice, software horror stories, and updates about what I'm up to.
