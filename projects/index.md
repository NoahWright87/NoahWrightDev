# Projects
Like many software engineers, I like to relax after a hard day's work of programming by sitting down and programming some more.  Here you'll find some of my side projects that I do for fun and to learn new technology outside of work.

### Level Up Learning
A side-project that started as a way to teach my kids their spelling words but has slowly grown bigger and bigger.  It is not under active development, but I still tinker with it from time to time.

### Let's Make a Program
My technical learning-focused site that is a mixture of basic tutorials for newbies and me "learning in public.

### Game Done Wright
I've got a few games on itch.io that I made in Unity.

# Mini-Projects
This is a spot for little things that I have played around with in order to try something new.
They don't have another proper place, so they live here on my dev site.
