Like many software engineers, I like to relax after a hard day's work of programming by sitting down and programming some more.  Here you'll find some of my side projects that I do for fun and to learn new technology outside of work.

<!-- ## Mini-Projects
This is a spot for little things that I have played around with in order to try something new.
They don't have another proper place, so they live here on my dev site.
