//TODO:
- My wife has been noticing my weird habits since WFH started.  Some are helpful and some are just funny - this post is to talk about all of it
- The good:
    - Rubber duck
    - Tomato timer
    - Time boxing
    - Exercise
- The bad
    - Imposter syndrome
    - Staring at the screen (talk about how a fast-typing coder isn't doing anything hard)
    - Hygiene
