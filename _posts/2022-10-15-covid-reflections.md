//TODO: Talk about how this summer is different from the seemingly 2-year "summer" of COVID

2020 was a crazy year.  I was excited to start my first post-Air Force civilian job, and on my first day of work I was told the office was closing -- like it or not, I suddenly had a work-from-home job.  Shortly after, my kids were sent home on an early spring break that ended up lasting 1.5 years.  It was rough, but now that the dust is settled, I'd like to share the lessons I've learned from it all.

> TL;DR:
> - I have a new appreciation for my wife.  I wouldn't have made it without her.
> - WFH is great *for me*.
> - WFH isn't for everybody -- especially first graders.

Intro

## Relationship changes
My Air Force job involved some long hours.  I left the house when everyone was still asleep, and I barely made it back in time for dinner.  In the 10 to 11 hours I was gone all day, my wife was *very, very busy*, especially over the summer when all the kids were home.



- I didn't appreciate her like I do now

## WFH pros
- I can't live without WFH now that the "genie's out of the bottle"
- Medical appointments are great

## WFH cons
- Not every business knows what to do
- Not every school knows what to do either
- Team building is hard

## Summary
