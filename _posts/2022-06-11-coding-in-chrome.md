//TODO:
- Been at Google a little while now and it has taken some getting used to programming inside of a browser
- Weirdly enough, I'm coding *this* in a browser right now.  Talk about how you can hit `.` or change the .com to .dev in GitHub to edit pages in an online VS Code editor
- Compare to my behemoth gaming laptop, which is what I've always tried to buy
- Future plan: get a RIDICULOUSLY POWERFUL desktop and a RIDICULOUSLY LIGHTWEIGHT laptop.  I can then:
    - Edit small stuff like this in the browser
    - Remote into desktop for heavier programming tasks
    - Still play Steam, etc on my TV / phone / thin laptop


> TL;DR:
> - I do all my work at Google on a Chromebook, and it has worked surprisingly well
