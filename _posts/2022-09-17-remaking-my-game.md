//TODO: Talk about the experience of making the game.  This isn't a technical article, it's about what I noticed making the game this time vs when I was younger
- The good:
    - I know programming a lot more, tend to plan ahead and not "paint myself into a corner" as much
    - I remember some of the old patterns I used
    - I'm better at getting stuck
- The bad:
    - No time - kids, chores, job, exercise, college, etc.  When I was young I had SO MUCH TIME
    - Idea that I'll be famous is gone
    - Unity has changed since I last touched it
- Some things don't change:
    - I play the game more than I program
    - "Market research" isn't helpful - I just keep playing others' games
    - I still dream big, unrealistic dreams

> TL;DR:
> - 1
> - 2
> - 3
