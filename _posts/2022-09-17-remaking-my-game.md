I've written before about how [making video games made me a better programmer](/_posts/2022-01-15-game-programming.md), and I'd like to continue that work.  I've also written about how [I lost all the code for my game](/_posts/2021-12-18-long-lost-code.md) and many other projects.  If I want to work on my game, I'll have to *re*create it from the ground up -- and that's exactly what I'm doing!


//TODO: Talk about the experience of making the game.  This isn't a technical article, it's about what I noticed making the game this time vs when I was younger
- The good:
    - I know programming a lot more, tend to plan ahead and not "paint myself into a corner" as much
    - I remember some of the old patterns I used
    - I'm better at getting stuck
- The bad:
    - No time - kids, chores, job, exercise, college, etc.  When I was young I had SO MUCH TIME
    - Idea that I'll be famous is gone
    - Unity has changed since I last touched it
- Some things don't change:
    - I play the game more than I program
    - "Market research" isn't helpful - I just keep playing others' games
    - I still dream big, unrealistic dreams

> TL;DR:
> - The good: I've grown ***a lot** as a programmer.
> - The bad: my life is a lot more complicated these days.
> - The same: I still like *playing* games more than *making* games.


## I know a thing or two because I've seen a thing or two

I've got roughly 10 years of professional experience and more like 20 years if you include all my personal programming time.  Sure, a lot of it was spent programming *business* software, but those skills still translate.

When I was young and first working on my game, I had to look up how to do *every.  Single.  Thing.*  Small development tasks took way too long because I was spending more time learning than doing.  Worst of all, I fell for the same trap as many young programmers: I thought I had to make *everything* myself.

Now, I'm making my game in Unity, and I'm letting it handle the hard stuff.  Years ago, I was trying to build everything from scratch.  Sure, I learned a lot of
