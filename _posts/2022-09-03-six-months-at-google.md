//TODO: Reflect on my first few months at Google.  Things to talk about:

- Everybody is so smart
    - I look people up in LinkedIn and am almost always blown away.  I've got such a different background, it feels like
    - Actually a lot of people have odd backgrounds
- Everyone I've met is also REALLY nice
- Seeing behind the curtain is fun just because.  Not like I know anything ***TOP SECRET*** but it's neat anyway
- The sheer overwhelming amount of stuff
    - So many acronyms
    - Almost every tool / system is built by Google for Google.  Sometimes there are analogous things outside Google, sometimes not, sometimes I'm not sure
- It's big, which is good and bad:
    - Good: I could potentially impact many people
    - Bad: I could potentially impact many people NEGATIVELY
