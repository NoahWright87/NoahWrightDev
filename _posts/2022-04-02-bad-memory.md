The boss has come to your daily standup to share their master plan that will increase profits next quarter.  You're hanging onto every word being said, knowing that this is your opportunity to make a good impression.  You're going to get a raise if you can pull this off.  No, you're going to get *promoted*!  The boss closes out the meeting, "I'm counting on you folks to get this done ASAP!"  You walk out, pumped about this big project, and suddenly it hits you:

***You forgot half of what the boss just said*** 😧

Bad memory is awful.  Trust me, I get it.  One time I went to the fridge to get something, and by the time I opened the door I forgot what I needed.  I've had bad memory for as long as I can remember, and the above scenario is my worst nightmare.

As a person with terrible memory, I have spent my whole life figuring out ways to keep things straight in my head.  Over time, I've developed habits that compensate for my forgetfulness.  Here's what works for me and will hopefully help you too:

## 📝 Notes
I know, it seems obvious, but it's worth saying anyway: **write down important stuff!!**  A lot of people (myself included) find that if they try to write down too much that they miss details while writing their notes.  So what should you be writing down?

### 🎯 Action items
In the intro scenario, the boss is laying out plans.  Presumably, you were assigned some tasks.  If there isn't already a written record of it in something like Jira, *write down the task*.  If you tell somebody "I'll get back to you about that," write a note that says what you owe them and when.  New jobs have a ton of jargon - rather than interrupt every couple minutes with *what do all these acronyms mean!?* you can write down the unfamiliar terms and look them up / ask your boss later.

### 🤔 Instructions / Documentation
Ah, documentation, the thing every engineer loves to read but hates to write.  The state of documentation within each company is highly variable, and it seems like every place has all kinds of unwritten processes that everybody else has memorized.  When somebody walks you through a process, write down the steps.  At first, this can be shorthand that is just enough that you could repeat the process a second time.  Later, you can take the time to flesh it out with all the details.  Eventually, you should put those instructions somewhere your coworkers can access.  *Side note: helpful little things like this make you seem like a rock star and will help your case for promotions and raises!*

The same thing applies when you have to figure out something without instructions.  It could be resolving a weird bug, gathering some info, or any number of little things.  For example, I've had several jobs where someone asks "hey, could you run a report and get X, Y, and Z data for me?"  There's not actually a report for this data, so I have to write some SQL to gather it.  Any time this is more complicated than just one table, I **always** include the SQL query with the email / Excel sheet I send with the data.  Nine times out of ten, the same person comes back later and says "oh hey, can you pull that data again, but this time *get more recent data / limit it by column X / etc*".  Instead of having to redo all the original work, I can grab the SQL I sent the first time, make some tweaks, and finish the task really fast.  Once again, this makes you look like one of those fabled 10x Developers™, because you go **so much faster** the second time.

### 🤝 Hand-off to Future You™
It's 5PM, you've been working on the same problem for hours, and you're "*this close* to finishing!"  If you've been here before, you know that you will probably A) keep working on it all night and B) not make much progress.  This is partially memory advice and partially work-life balance advice, but please, **stop doing that!**

Instead, write a little note to yourself.  I do this every day, even when I'm not in the middle of something intense.  I commit the code I was working on (ya know, in case my computer explodes overnight) and write a quick note to myself.  It'll look something like this:

> Dear Morning Noah:
> - Working on `CoolFunction`.  Almost done, but `TroublingProcess` returns null and I don't know why 😭
> - Boss needs Z by 10am.  See email subject "Big Task" for details
> - Clean up that sloppy thing you did in `FileABC` before pushing commits

As you can see, this A) is brief, B) clearly is just for me, and C) tells me where I need to go to finish what I was working on.  The uncanny thing about this is that most of the time, I wake up the next morning and *immediately* figure out the thing that had me blocked the day before.  That's a subject for another blog post, but something magical happens when you get a good night's rest.

This handoff is *especially* important on Friday evening.  If you've got bad memory like me, you're going to braindump *everything* over the weekend.  This is why you absolutely have to communicate to your future self, which brings me directly to the next area of advice:

## ⌚ Reminders
You wrote down a grocery list and made all kinds of plans last night.  *I'll run to the store in the morning and get those things I need for dinner*.  You woke up today and went about your business.  You sit down to eat lunch when it creeps up on you.  *Wait... wasn't I supposed to do something today?* 🤔

***Oh crap, I forgot to go buy the roast!***

All the notes you take aren't much good if you don't do anything with them.  This is where reminders come into play.

### 🎀 Physical Tricks
You ever hear of somebody tying a ribbon around their finger to remember something?  If you watch *Worst Cooks in America*, you'll see Chef Anne Burrell put red marker on people's fingers who hold their chef knives dangerously.  These are the classic low-tech sorts of reminders that people have used *basically forever*.

I think of them as Reminder Landmines.  When I think of something that I need to do tomorrow, I place a *Landmine* in my path so that I will "step on it" and not forget.  Maybe I check the weather and see it's going to storm tomorrow *afternoon*.  My forgetful self will see sunny skies tomorrow morning and forget, so I hang an umbrella on the doorknob *right now* so I see it tomorrow.  That bill I need to pay?  I set it on my keyboard so I can't start working without coming across it and remembering to deal with it.

Giving yourself tangible, physical reminders can be helpful, and there are tons of ways to do it.  You may already do similar things, like hanging your calendar so it's in your field of view or putting your grocery list on your fridge at eye level.  Now just apply these habits to work.

### 📅 Calendars Reminders
I just mentioned putting a calendar in your path as a trick, but is that enough to make sure you look at it?  Hmmm 🤔

Luckily, we live in the future and you don't have to rely on reading a piece of paper!  I know some people love the tactile feel of paper and seeing a physical calendar, but that piece of paper can't send you a push notifications!  I almost never write down physical to-do lists or calendar appointments.  Instead, I whip out my phone and jot it down there.  Even more, I make sure to set a notification so that my phone will alert me *even if I don't look at the calendar app!*

There are some to-do list apps that will help with this as well.  I've been using [Todoist](https://todoist.com/){:target="_blank"} for a while now, and it lets you set dates for your TODO items.  I hate having a TODO list that's 5 miles long, so when things get too jumbled up I go through the list and assign dates to spread the work out.  "I'll pick that up tomorrow morning, I can wait til Wednesday to call them back, and the grass doesn't need mowing until next week."  One cool thing about Todoist is that you can write words like "by next Friday" in the description of your TODO item and Todoist will automatically interpret it as a date, making it *really* fast and easy to schedule things.

### 🔊 Smart Speakers
I don't know about you, but I've got an uncomfortable number of smart speakers in my house.  Amazon is constantly running deals on their smaller smart speaker, the [Echo Dot](https://amzn.to/3vqN9LW){:target="_blank"}{% include affiliate-notice.html %}, and I may have a bit of a shopping problem 😅.  Over time, I have bought enough to have one in every room, and I use them *extensively* for reminders.

"*🎵ding🎵, this is your reminder: tell your mother happy birthday.*"  Whoops, better get my phone!  "🎵ding🎵, don't forget to take your medicine.*"  Oh yeah, I totally forgot that!  "🎵ding🎵, it's bed time!*"  Okay, this one *I* don't forget, but it keeps my kids on track.  If you were at my house, you'd hear a regular stream of reminders that I have set up.  It's almost too much.  *Almost*.

In fact, our friends and family roll their eyes when they hear my constant reminders, but I will stress this again: *my memory is **awful!***  Thanks to my small army of smart speakers, it's a lot harder to forget things.  If you don't have a smart speaker, you can use Siri or Google Assistant on your phone to do the same thing.  A quick "*Hey Google, remind me every morning at 9 to do XYZ*" and you're all set.

## 📃 Leave a paper trail
Alright, you're in a meeting and you take notes.  *Easy*.  You're completing a tricky, undocumented task and you document it.  *Makes sense*.  Now you're in a one-on-one, verbal conversation with a coworker.  *What now?!*

### 📲 Can you text that to me?
A little bit of honesty goes a long way.  Don't hide your bad memory - let *everybody* know.  Make sure they understand why you're pulling your phone out to take notes or put something on your calendar.  *Sorry, I'll forget this in 10 seconds if I don't write it down.  I want to make sure I do this for you!*  Now instead of looking rude, people appreciate your attention to their matter.

Another favorite trick of mine is to tell people I have bad memory and ask them to send me things in writing.  The whole thing is surprisingly organic.  They start telling me directions to get somewhere and I interrupt with "just text me the address so I've got it later.  I'm probably gonna forget all these directions."  Nobody gets upset.  They usually respond with "oh yeah, duh, smartphones are a thing!"  At the end of meetings, I will ask all the people who tasked me with something to get their phones out and email/text me what they needed and when they need it.  It puts a tiny bit of work on them but massively increases the odds that I don't forget things, so most people will gladly send me reminder texts or emails.

Side note: making a habit of this is a great way to keep people honest.  I voluntarily text/email the summary of conversations to people who promised me things.  Later, if they don't deliver, I can say ***with proof*** that they said they'd help me out.  Don't pull this *haha, gotcha!* manuever too much, though, or everybody will **really** hate you.

### 📧 Dear Future Me™
On a related note, don't be afraid to email yourself.  This is especially important if you keep your personal phone away from your work area.  In the Air Force, I have worked in secure areas that don't allow outside cell phones.  So how do I get to all my electronic TODO lists and calendar reminders while at work there?

When I suddenly remember something for work at 9pm, I grab my phone and send a message to my work email address.  I don't even write a body to the email, I just put something like "Reminder: call Sgt ABC about project XYZ" in the subject line.  The next day I sit down at work and see an email (okay, usually several) from myself with a reminder in the subject line.  It works like a charm.

## 📂 Organization and Search 🔍
If you're keeping track, you're probably thinking that all of the above is going to generate a **ton** of notes.  You're not wrong.

Two things:
1) You don't have to do *everything* above.  These are the things that work for me, and you may have better memory than me and only need a couple of them.
2) If you did all of the above *on paper* it'd be overwhelming, but **we live in the future, folks!**

Pretty much any Google product is searchable.  I have notes in Keep, Drive, and Gmail - all three of which are easily searchable.  If you're deliberate about how you write your notes, they can become really easy to find.  I carry my old programmer habit of writing `TODO` into my note-taking, so I can search for "TODO" in my notes and quickly get tasks I may have forgotten.  In Gmail, you can enter searches like `from:personalemail@gmail.com to:workemail@work.com` to find those reminder emails you sent - better yet, you can save that search as a filter for later!

As your pile of notes grows, it becomes more and more important to get good at searching.  Put some effort into how you phrase your notes and keep that in mind when searching.  Essentially, the one thing I do commit to memory is *how I write notes*, so I can quickly find anything I've written later on.

## 🏁 Summary
Don't let bad memory hold you back.  I can't say it enough times: *we're living in some sci-fi futuristic times, y'all!*  Use all the technology around you and let it be a second brain that is *way* better at remembering things.

> The TL;DR version:
> - Write notes about action items
> - Record instructions for complicated tasks
> - Jot down what you're doing at the end of the work day
> - Put reminders in your path, physically and with technology
> - Utilize search to find all of the above when needed
