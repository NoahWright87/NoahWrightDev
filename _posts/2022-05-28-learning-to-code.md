*"How do you get into programming?  Where should I start?"*

I get this question *all the time*.  For a long time, I didn't have a great answer, because I got started roughly 20 years ago - not only do I not remember exactly how it went, a lot has changed since then.  I've given it some thought, and I'd like to write up my thoughts about getting into programming here.
